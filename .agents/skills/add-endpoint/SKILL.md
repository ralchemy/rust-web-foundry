name: add-endpoint
description: Add or change an HTTP endpoint in this five-crate Rust web workspace. Use when a request affects an Axum route, HTTP contract, use case, domain rule, Port, or adapter.

# Add an endpoint

1. Classify the planned touched paths and applicable action keys, then compile or reuse the bounded Context Pack required by root `AGENTS.md`. Read the pack once; do not independently preload Guide chapters.
2. Trace the nearest existing public route through Application and adapters. Reuse its owners before adding files or abstractions. When the trace expands touched paths or action classes, rebuild the pack and read only newly selected `ref@content-sha` entries.
3. Complete the routed Domain outcome and design checkpoint before production edits. Record the boundary conversion matrix: source type, target type, `FromStr`/`TryFrom`/`From` or named Domain operation, conversion owner, and failure owner.
4. Write one failing test at the innermost changed public seam. Touch only layers required by the behavior.
5. Work inside out through only the required owners: Domain invariant; Application use case or Port when orchestration or a business decision exists; Infrastructure adapter when an external capability exists; HTTP DTO/error/handler/route; then app wiring when construction changes.
6. Keep external details at adapters and fixed public failures in HTTP. Guide and Domain owners are read-only unless the active task explicitly declares Governance or Documentation scope.
7. Run the focused test, then `just check`. Run `just verify` when wiring, configuration, lifecycle, migrations, checked SQL, or the installed route graph changed.
8. Handoff with a compact Evidence Pack: Context Pack identity, changed paths, public acceptance path, checks and outcomes, material decisions, and unresolved blockers. Leave final conformance to a fresh review stage.
