description: Add and verify a forward MySQL migration in this Rust web workspace. Use when schema, indexes, constraints, or persisted Task data must change.

# Add a migration

1. Compile or reuse the bounded Context Pack for the planned Infrastructure paths and applicable action keys. Read the pack once; do not independently preload whole Guide chapters.
2. Inspect the current migrations and every checked query affected by the schema change. If the query or touched-path set expands, rebuild the pack and read only newly selected `ref@content-sha` entries.
3. Complete the routed design checkpoint before production edits. Add the next forward-only SQL file under `crates/infrastructure/migrations/` as `YYYYMMDDNNN_information.sql`, incrementing the three-digit sequence within that date. SQLx requires the underscore after the integer version. Do not rewrite an already released migration.
4. Keep MySQL 8.4 compatibility and review locks, table scans, constraint rollout, and rollback operations before choosing SQL.
5. Update checked queries and the real MySQL integration assertion in the same change.
6. Run `just sqlx-prepare` and commit the resulting `.sqlx` changes.
7. Run the focused test and `just verify` against MySQL. Production still uses the application-owned `migrate` command; never add migration-on-serve behavior. Routed owners remain read-only unless the task explicitly declares Governance or Documentation scope.
8. Handoff with a compact Evidence Pack instead of the discovery transcript or full command logs.
