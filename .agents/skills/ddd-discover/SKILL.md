description: Discover and clarify a business capability before implementation. Use when a capability is new or its actors, terminology, commands, domain events, rules, scope, or exceptional outcomes are unclear or not confirmed in the project's Domain docs.

# Discover a Domain capability

Establish evidence-backed business understanding. Do not design code or infrastructure.

1. Compile or reuse the bounded Context Pack for planned artifact paths with `domain-discovery` and `domain-workflow`, plus only other action keys that actually apply. Read the pack once; do not read the whole Domain owner by default.
2. Read the relevant confirmed `CONTEXT.md` or `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, capability documents, ADRs, and active issue or requirement selected by that context.
3. State the business value, goals, non-goals, actors, and constraints supported by the available evidence.
4. Walk concrete timelines. For each scenario, identify the actor's intent, preconditions, business command, past-tense Domain fact, outcome, and material exception.
5. Classify every material statement as **Fact**, **Assumption**, or **Open Question**. Cite its source or name who must confirm it. Never promote an assumption by repeating it.
6. Identify terminology conflicts, rule and invariant candidates, missing decisions, and possible semantic boundaries. Treat boundaries as clues, not conclusions.
7. Ask only questions whose answers change business behavior, ownership, or acceptance. Do not invent scenarios to meet a quota.

Produce only the sections that add information:

- **Scope**: business value, goals, non-goals, constraints.
- **Scenario timeline**: actor, intent, precondition, command, Domain fact, outcome.
- **Language**: term, meaning, status, source, conflicting term.
- **Rules and questions**: rule candidate, evidence, uncertainty, confirmer.
- **Handoff**: call `ddd-strategic-design` only for a real semantic-boundary decision; call `ddd-tactical-design` when invariants, states, or business types must be designed.

Keep assumptions and open questions in the active issue or plan. Before persisting confirmed terms or capability semantics, add `domain-authority` and, when needed, `domain-capability-doc`, rebuild the Context Pack, and read only the new owner sections. Do not choose crates, APIs, tables, messaging, retries, or other technical mechanisms.
